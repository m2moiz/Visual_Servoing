# Visual Servoing Project

This repository contains the code for the final project of the visual servoing course

## Problem Statement

A camera is mounted onto the ceiling using which we can view the workspace below. We want to move the robot using only the camera feed as the sensory input. 

### Objectives

Concretely we can define the objectives as:

 1. Get the current pose (Rotation and Orientation) of the Robot (Turtlebot3).
2. Make the Robot move to an arbitrary position in the workspace specified by the user.
 3. Make the robot avoid obstacles placed in the enviroment, whle moving to the goal position.
